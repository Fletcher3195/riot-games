# Getting Started :memo:

In order to run this project locally, and hopefully contribute you will need to install a few things. Namely,

- [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once you have those out of the way, we need to set up a mobile development environment. React Native's website does a stellar job at this. You can find the documents [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
